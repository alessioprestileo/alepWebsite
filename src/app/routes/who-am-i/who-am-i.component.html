          Well, that's a pretty difficult question to answer...<br />
          If you are looking for a
          slim, concise resume of my competences and studies, then you should
          definitely go to the section "My CV".

          If you are curious to know a little more about me, here's a little info
          about my life:<br />
          I was born in Genoa, Italy, on the 20th of July 1986. I grew up and studied
          in Genoa, realizing as time went by that the most satisfying activity for me
          was to learn new things, the more the better. During my school years, I
          acquired a very good knowledge of the latin grammar, which helped me
          significantly in learning foreign languages.<br />
          By the time a was in university, my hunger for new experiences had resulted
          in a wide spectrum of interests, from sports to music, going through
          literature and languages.

        <p>
          During my last year in university I spent 6 months studying in the
          University of Lisbon, Portugal and that turned out to be a real game
          changer: I couldn't get enough of the new language, all the new places
          (the ocean!), the new people around me. That was also the beginning of my
          passion for surfing.<br />
          I discovered my love for the writer José Saramago, and learned Portuguese
          from his books. I also fell in Love with the city of Lisbon, which is still
          my absolute favorite.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          After coming back to Genoa, I finished my Master's Degree in Naval
          Architecture and graduated with top grades, cum laude. My master's thesis
          was awarded the title of best thesis in Naval Architecture in the University of
          Genoa in 2011. Based on my thesis, I wrote an article that was published on
          the technical magazine "Marine Structures". My co-authors were my supervisor
          Prof. Enrico Rizzuto from Genoa, Prof. Ângelo Palos Teixeira and Prof.
          Carlos Guedes Soares from Lisbon.

          When I started looking for my first job, the only certain thing was that it
          had to be abroad: I had enjoyed so much my experience in Portugal and I
          couldn't think about anything more exciting than trying again in a new
          country.<br /> The new country happened to be Norway.

          Throughout university, I had always heard good things about the norwegian
          Classification Society, Det Norske Veritas, so I decided to apply for a job
          at their headquarters in Oslo, Norway. I got the job and in September 2011 I
          moved to Oslo, where I still live today.<br />
          These five years in Norway gave me many precious lessons. At work, I learned
          how to be a good FE analyst, how to work effectively and with integrity, and
          how to base the interaction with my colleagues on co-operation and not on
          competition. My colleagues taught me everything I needed to know to do a
          good job, and they also helped me a lot in learning Norwegian.<br />
          Out of the office, I learned what it means to live in a society based on
          tolerance, justice, respect, and humility.

          My time in Det Norske Veritas/DNVGL finished in the end of 2015. During that
          year, the oil price had quite suddenly fallen to roughly 1/3 of his usual
          value, resulting in a very low activity in my office, where practically all
          of the projects were connected to the oil industry. I started to feel that I
          wasn't learning enough, and that feeling, together with the constant growth
          of my interest for computer programming, convinced me to quit and start a
          new career.

          After several months of studying and experimenting, I found a job as a full-stack 
          junior developer at <a href="https://07interaktiv.no">07interaktiv</a>. I worked 
          there for one year, and then went on to work as a consultant for <a href="https://www.acando.no">Acando</a>,
          where I am currently employed.
