      My name is Alessio Prestileo, I am a computer programmer specialized in
      Angular 2 with a solid engineering background.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have 4.5 years of experience as a structural engineer, which has been
      my profession in Det Norske Veritas/DNVGL roughly from 2011 to 2016.<br />
      During my years as an engineer I realized that programming (python
      scripting at the time) was definitely the activity that interested me the
      most.<br />
      At the end of 2015 I decided to start a new career as a software
      developer. After spending some months studying in deep the basic concepts
      of software design and experimenting with C++ and 3D graphics (OpenGL), I
      turned my attention to front-end development with Angular 2, which is now
      my main focus.

      In this website you can find information about my life, my competences and
      the most recent Angular 2 projects I've been working on.
      In addition to the mentioned projects, which you can find in the
      "Projects" section, this website was entirely built with Angular 2, and
      you can check out the source code by following
